# Welcome to my project.

This is a showcase of how I integrate React and Node.JS through an API and model the data accordingly and save them to a global state using the Context API.

On the root folder, install all the dependencies and run "npm run dev". Concurrently will take care of the rest and make both apps run at the same time, so you don't have to worry about a thing.
